# Access #
## A utility for thrilling admin privileges acquisition ##

Remember the famous "You didn't say the magic word" scene from Jurassic park? This
simple program reproduces a more modern version of the infamous Dennis Nedry's trolling
hack to the Jurassic Park systems. The program is a simple wrapper to the sudo UNIX
utility. Just substitute the "sudo" command with "access" and use it exactly as sudo.
But be careful! If you don't type your password correctly... you could forget to say
the magic word!
